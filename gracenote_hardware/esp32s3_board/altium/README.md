**Altium Subdirectory for Custom ESP32-S3 Board**

- This subdirectory contains all design, schematic, and custom library files used for the GraceNote ESP32-S3 board:

	(i) The 'esp32s3_wroom.PcbLib' custom footprint library containing footprints for the components used in the board (more on this below).

	(ii) The 'esp32s3_wroom.SchLib' custom schematic library containing symbols for the components used in the board (more on this below).

	(iii) The 'gerb.zip' folder containing the gerber files for the board.

	(iv) The 'gracenoteESP_PCB.pdf' PDF file showing the top and bottom signal layers of the board.

	(v) The 'gracenoteESP_schematic.pdf' PDF file showing the schematic for the board.

**Custom Symbol and Footprint Libraries**

- As mentioned earlier, some of the components that were ordered for the board did not have readily available schematic symbols or PCB footprints. Using the datasheets of these components, the 'esp32s3_wroom.PcbLib' and 'esp32s3_wroom.SchLib' files collectively provide:
